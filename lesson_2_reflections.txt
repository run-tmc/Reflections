What happens when you initialize a repository?  Why do you need to do it?   After the "git init" command is executed, the repository is set up to generate git files.  This command is required when version control commits will be used on the files in the repository.
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository?  What value do you think it offers.  The staging area allow the user to select which files that git will commit as a bundle in the respository. The staging area provides the user with flexibility value to select which files need to be bundled.
